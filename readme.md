# zsh-toolbox

## Usability
please see codeberg for new versions:
https://codeberg.org/paxcoder/zshutils
- You can for now: see the welcome message, and there's alias `mz` to `omz`
- Now, in version 0.2 you see your ZSH version, the output of `uname` and the plugin's version
- [homebrew](https://brew.sh) packages will update automaticaly if you set it to do so, exclusive for 3.0

## Configuring

- `zt_welcome 0, 1, yes, no` - Sets display of welcome message.
- `zt_aliases 0, 1, yes, no` - Turns on or off loading the plugin's aliases
- `zt_brew` - Update [homebrew](https://brew.sh) packages automaticaly.

## Contributions

You can contribute, but remember to ask if the feature will be useful.
I am trying to add this plugin to ZSH's repo to install it by default.
